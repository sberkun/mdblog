...I should learn khan academy macroeconomics course


what i really want to write about is price anchors
 - gold has its value anchored by jewelry and electronics
 - land and food are anchored by being necessary
 - a lot of stuff is more vaguely derived by circumstance

bitcoin is not anchored to anything!

open Sam's burger shack. you can buy burger tokens, and redeem them for burgers
 - value of burger token is anchored by general price of burger
 - I could theoretically go to a grocery store and pay for ground beef with burger tokens
 - people pay each other with burger tokens
 - if I have 1,000,000 burger tokens, do I have $5 million?
    - probably not...

 - take burger token off of the burger!







# Bitcoin is not Gold

Gold is pretty famous as a store of wealth. For most of human history, 



## Limited Supply

Traditional currency (i.e. good ol' American dollars) is also a store of wealth.
But the government can always just...print more money if it wants to. Inflation
is simply a fact for all currencies, and in extreme cases (i.e. Germany and Zimbabwe),
hyper-inflation has made massive stores of wealth effectively worthless.  

Gold is not subject to inflation because it has to be physically dug out of the
ground. This means that, unless mining becomes drastically cheaper, gold will
keep its value for the forseeable future.

Bitcoin is actually better than gold in this regard. The supply of bitcoin is
fixed; no more will ever be created.


## Stable Shelf Life

Suppose that instead of gold, you bought potatoes. Tons and tons of potatoes.
So many potatoes that McDonalds has to stop making french fries. What would happen
after a year?

Your potatoes would rot, and you would be a pauper. This is one of the reasons
why gold has been such a good store of wealth throughout history; it doesn't
rust, rot, evaporate, or decay. If you have a solid gold coin and someone drops
a hammer on it, it just turns into a flatter gold coin with the exact same value.

Bitcoin, being digital, is pretty shelf stable. If you keep your keys on a high
quality hardware wallet (with backups), you could probably keep your bitcoin
for hundreds of years.


## Easy to protect

If you are very wealthy, you naturally worry about people stealing your money.
Not silly, ordinary people... more like governments and political opponents.

This might even be your primary concern depending on your occupation. If you're
a pirate, for example, you want to be very sure that if a government catches you,
they don't have the opportunity to seize your assets. If you can keep your assets,
you keep some negotiating power to try to keep yourself from getting hanged. One
way you might want to do so is by burying gold in a remote island that only you
know the location of. Then when the government says "where's the gold?", you
can tell your buddies to grab the gold and negotiate your freedom.

Bitcoin is even better than gold at this; If you have a hardware wallet that
only you know the password too, there is no way for the government to seize
your bitcoin. Sure, they might seize the hardware wallet, but they can't do
anything with it. And if they destroy the hardware wallet, well, that's why
you have backups. 


## Reliable Demand

Suppose that if instead of gold, you bought artwork: lots of rare and beautiful
paintings from renown artists. What might happen to your stash in 10 years?

Well, people might care less about art than they used to, and previously renown
artists might fall out of fashion. Your previously expensive paintings might be
reduced to cheap living room decor. In particular, if a recession hits, people
might be concerned about buying food and other necessities - in that case,
your expensive paintings might as well be firewood.

Gold, on the other hand, is a commodity. It's shiny and doesn't rust, so it's
good for making jewelry and other shiny objects. In modern times, its also
used for electronics. Admittedly, there's still some danger of gold falling out
of fashion (i.e. if the world collectively decides that gold is really ugly, and
platinum jewelry becomes the standard), but in comparison to other commodities,
gold is quite safe.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is only a currency. People might decide that Bitcoin
is stupid, or that Ethereum is vastly superior, and the worldwide market for
Bitcoin would instantly dry up.  This is the fundamental flaw behind all
cryptocurrencies - there's nothing to "anchor" their demand. They're not even shiny.

Some cryptocurrencies have attempted to correct this. For example, there are
"stablecoins" that are backed by gold or other precious metals. But these rely
on the issuing company honoring their word, which is...questionable in an industry
built on nobody trusting each other.


## So if not Bitcoin, what then?
