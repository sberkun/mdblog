title:  "The Industrial De-volution"
---


Imagine yourself as a weaver in the early 1800s. Newfangled knitting frames are
threatening your skilled job: an unskilled laborer using a knitting frame can
weave low-quality lace for a fraction of the price of your high-quality, hand-woven
lace.

Imagine yourself as a software developer in the early 2000s. Newfangled "coding
assistants" are threatening to take your job. A college freshman with Claude or
Copilot can pump out CRUD apps like water. Sure, they're terrible and buggy and
full of code that would make any competent developer cry, but they work and
they're _cheap_. A week of a software developer's time costs thousands of dollars.
A few hours of a college student's time costs maybe $50. That price makes CEOs
and venture capitalists salivate.

Of course, the right answer is probably neither of these extremes. Instead,
some people are hoping for a rise of the "100x developer": a senior-level
engineer who does the high-level design, uses AI for the easy tasks, and can
tackle the most challenging tasks by herself. A perfect blend of man and machine.

Some people call this the second industrial revolution. That's probably an
exaggeration - the aforementioned people want to sell AI to you. But if they're
right, industrial revolutions come with growing pains.


## Cutting the life cycle

There's a major problem with a new revolution: education. In most previous revolutions,
humans ended up being needed for higher-level tasks: engineering, overseeing, and
troubleshooting the machines doing their previous jobs. But engineering requires a
lot more knowledge than factory work, so society as a whole needs more education.

In previous centuries, a man with no schooling at all could successfully support
his family as a farmer, or as a factory worker. In previous decades, a person
with a high school education could earn a living as a stenographer, a clerk,
or a cabinet maker. And in this decade, a person with a college education can
be a marketing manager, recruiter, or software engineer.

The previous jobs didn't disappear, but they did shrink. Jobs requiring more education
tended to expand while the others contracted. But society is reaching a limit.
Already, people suspect that a college education is not right for everyone. What
will happen when most jobs require a Master's degree? Or a PhD? Will a majority
of the population even be able to complete a PhD?

I suspect that we'll start to see a large gap. Jobs requiring high levels of
experience, education, and knowledge will become extremely in demand, and command
high salaries. At the same time, there will be an oversupply of young, bright,
college-educated people entering the workforce with nobody willing to hire them.
After all, why hire an entry-level writer when ChatGPT can do the same work
for a fraction of minimum wage?

This will continue for a few decades. There will be many, many college-educated
waiters and dishwashers and janitors, and a few very highly-paid tech workers. Then
someday, the highly-paid tech workers will start to retire, and there will be nobody
to replace them. The people who would have replaced them never got hired at the
entry level, so they never got experience. Worse still, people who would have entered
college saw this oversupply of college-educated minimum wage workers, and decided
to go to trade school and become plumbers instead. So by the time companies
realize they have a hiring problem, its too late, and there is simply nobody
who knows enough to help the AI do its job.

It's analogous to crushing every bug that can't fly: without the caterpillars,
you'll run out of butterflies.

## Solutions

Maybe the answer is more education. Rather than a 4-year college degree being
standard, an 8-year one should be. The problem is that education is expensive;
not very many people can afford 8 years of college tuition. In developed nations,
this isn't too much of a problem, because people support education with their taxes.
In less developed nations, they cut funding to top colleges and [dismantle the
department of education](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/),
putting even the existing 4-year system at risk.

So if the government won't educate people, and people can't afford to educate themselves,
what then? Maybe companies can educate people? In the past, college students
would do internships in parallel with their education. In the future, maybe the
internship replaces it.

The problem with this idea is that companies typically lose money on their interns.
Even at minimum wage, interns are nearly useless, and take time from full-time
employees who have to mentor them. An internship that replaces college would be
such a huge cost sink that no sane company would offer one ([Palantir is not a sane company](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-launches-anti-college-internship-for-high-school-grads-2025-4)). There are two ways to remedy this:

  1. "Reverse financed" internships: essentially, you pay the company for the internship,
     rather than the company paying you. Not only is this dystopian, but most people
     won't be able to afford this. We've seen this option before in the form of "coding bootcamps"
     and I don't have a high opinion of it.

  2. 10-year slavery contracts: essentially, the company agrees to pay you minimum
     wage for 10 years. In return, you get education, experience, and guaranteed
     employment until the contract ends. If you underperform, the company not only
     fires you, but you owe them a few million dollars (your "tuition"), which
     probably bankrupts you. You'll work 80-hour weeks in the most toxic environment
     possible to avoid being fired.

I'm actually really excited about option 2. With the USA dismantling both
education and worker's rights, it's becoming a real possibility. Some oligarchs
will probably make billions if it works out.

There's a third, much more boring solution. Maybe higher education does become the
norm, but it's prohibitively expensive, so only rich people can afford it. Only
a small number of people will be able to afford the education they need for these
very high-paying jobs, while the majority of the population is simply priced out.
This is already how it works for medicine and law, so it's not too far fetched
to imagine the same system being used in other areas.

## What can you do?

It depends who you are. If you've already started your career, you might be one
of the lucky few who gain their experience before the AI revolution, and end up
supervising as AI does your junior-level tasks. Maybe AI is already able to help
with your workflow and make you more productive.

If you're a high school or college student, the future is very uncertain. Within
the next decade, AI might replace entire fields, or it might stagnate. It might
be a good idea to stay flexible with your career options.

If you follow politics, you can try to vote for politicians that hold your values.
Maybe they can change the future for the better. Or maybe not. Ideas like
"support public education" tend to be pretty unpopular in certain countries these
days.
