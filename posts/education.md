# A tale of two educations

Public education in the great United States of America is pretty bad. By most
measures, bad [TODO: cite rankings]. Thankfully, that's about to change. Donald
Trump has chosen to "empower parents, states, and communities" by closing down
the department of education. I have two predictions. 
 - For most of America, this will make public education much, much worse. 
 - For a select few, this will empower them to make their education better.

Let's explore a hypothetical story of two young, bright Americans going through
the American school system.


## Meet Adam and Eve.

Adam is the son of two doctors, born somewhere in suburban Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a
fairly wealthy state with a fairly robust public education system [TODO: cite]. Adam is a bright,
chipper young boy with a natural curiosity and an appetite for learning. His elementary and
middle schools are well funded, and he has no shortage of patient, talented teachers.
Adam discovers his talents in math and english, and as a teenager, he aspires
to be a writer.

Eve is the daughter of a mechanic and a waitress in Alabama. Although her beginning
is a little more humble, she is also naturally curious, and has a knack for learning
things quickly. As a child, she spends her free time helping her dad in the shop,
and develops a reputation as the "child genius" for being able to diagnose issues
that even seasoned mechanics have trouble with. By the time she reaches high school,
she knows the inside of most cars better than the engineers that designed them.


## Adam's high school

Adam's parents want the best possible future for their son, so they enroll him
in a private high school. There's a rigorous application, but he's smart, and
it's expensive, but they have money. Adam thrives in his high school. He takes
precalculus, calculus, statistics, computer science, english, macroeconomics, and more, getting
As in all of them. This isn't unusual at Adam's school; since grades are important
for college applications, 85% of the students have 4.0s. Furthermore, Adam has a
healthy set of extracurriculars: he's active in sports, and is the president of
"Coding for Equality" club, one of the 15 computer science clubs at his high school.

When it is time to apply for colleges, Adams parents hire a private counselor to
guide Adam through the application process. It's expensive, but they have money.
Between Adam's natural writing talent and the counselor's edits, they craft an
impressive yet endearing personal statement for him, and several well-polished
supplemental essays. Adam asks a few of his favorite teachers for letters of
recommendation; they write glowing letters, just as they have for hundreds of
students before Adam. Adam submits his applications with weeks to spare and
waits excitedly for the results.


## Eve's high school

Eve's parents also want the best possible future for her, but a private high school
is further out of reach for them than a flying car. Eve's local high school has
had its budget slashed several times; by most accounts, it's barely surviving.
Eve takes "algebra", but the teacher can barely keep control of the class; most
of Eve's peers spend the entire class on their phones and haven't turned in homework
since the first week of school. Her "english" and "history" classes aren't much
better. Her senior year she takes "precalculus", which only has 5 students in it
(it wouldn't have even been offered, but Eve's parents begged the principle for it,
and Mr. Oldman offered to come out of retirement to teach it). Eve thrives in
this class, but they spend most of the year reviewing basics from "algebra", due
to all 5 students having shaky foundations in it.

Eve sets her sights on the American dream, and decides to apply for college. The
school counselor helps the best she can, but with hundreds of students to manage,
she can only spend a few minutes with Eve over Eve's entire senior year. Eve writes
the best essays she can, writes in her time at her dad's shop as an "extracurricular",
and submits her applications with a pit in her stomach.


## Adam's first year of college

Adam is admitted to HarYalePrinceford, one of the most prestigious universities
in the nation. Adam's parents are overjoyed when they hear the news; their little
boy is going to college! It's expensive, but they have money. Adam's major of
choice is Computer Science; not his favorite subject, but it has much better job
prospects than English.

For Adam's freshman year, he enrolls in multivariable calculus, physics II,
data structures, probability, robotics, and a few general education requirements.
The courses are tough, but Adam is smart, and his high school taught him good
study habits. He thrives in these classes. Towards the end of the year, he applies
to an internship at an undersea robotics company. They don't normally hire freshmen,
but HarYalePrinceford has a good reputation, and Adam has a strong technical background.
They hire Adam, and Adam spends the summer learning how to write robotics firmware. 


## Eve's first year of college

Eve's application isn't great, but an admissions officer at Neighboring State
University sees her potential and admits her with a scholarship. Eve's parents
are happy for her, but a little worried. NSU tuition is expensive, and they haven't
been able to save much over the years. But between their savings, Eve's scholarship,
and some student loans, they decide that it's worth it to send Eve to college. Eve
is interested in robotics, so after talking to her college counselor, she decides to
major in Computer Science. 

Eve knows that college will be hard, but she's smart, and she's determined to make
the most of her time at NSU. For her first year, she enrolls in calculus I, physics I,
Introductory Programming, and a few general education requirements. Unfortunately,
despite Eve's good performance in high school precalculus, Mr. Oldman didn't cover
all of NSU's expected precalculus material. Eve realizes this a few weeks into her
first semester; she quickly drops calculus I and enrolls in precalculus instead.
Unfortunately, this wreaks havoc on the rest of her schedule. Without calculus, she
can no longer take physics I, and at this point in the year, the only other course
she can sign up for is "Freshman Seminar". She ends up taking precalculus and
"Freshman Seminar" her first semester, and calculus I and physics I her second semester.

In May, she returns home exhausted, but determined to make the most of her next year.
She spends the summer digging through online textbooks to try to learn some calculus II
before her sophomore year starts.

## What this means for America

It means that social mobility is a farce, that's what.

It also means that science and research are about to get hit by a freight train.
Americans are graduating less educated than ever before. Research needs researchers,
and research labs across the country are going to struggle to find qualified applicants.
That's if they survive at all; Trump has slashed university funding as well.

Industry is going to suffer similar problems. Already, interns and new grads don't
deliver much value - in software engineering in particular, many of them are below
the level of ChatGPT or Copilot. This makes it very, very difficult to justify hiring
them, so we end up with a slight paradox. Companies will become _desperate_ to
hire senior engineers, while thousands of students graduate with nearly worthless
computer science degrees. Overall, technological progress will stall while companies
squabble over a limited supply of senior engineers.

The problem isn't Trump, or his attempt to shut down the department of education.
This problem has been building long before Trump took office. American reading and
math scores are lower than ever

## What can Neighboring State University Do?

TODO

 - fail to adapt. professors take matters into own hands, either failing large
   swaths of students or lowering standards
 - turn their 4-year program into a 6-year program
 - Encourage their students to get master's degrees. worst of both worlds; expensive
   and reputation still suffers. What happens when standards keep slipping? sacrifice
   their PhD program?

## What can HarYalePrinceford Do?

HarYalePrinceford has no interest in fixing anything; they benefit from this
arrangement. That being said, if HYP is out of reach for most
people, then only the richest students will apply, which means acceptance rates
won't be very low. This is a problem for HYP because their rankings in publications
like US News partly depend on low acceptance rates.

So every year, HYP admits a few students like Eve, and offers them
hefty scholarships so they can afford to attend. Unfortunately, despite HYP's valiant
efforts, the few Eves they admit barely makes a dent in the thousands that they
do not. Still, it's enough to give people hope.

So for students like Eve, HYP admissions becomes a lottery. High school students
around the country break their backs to try to become one of the few lucky ones.
Most fail. A tiny few get a future, and the rest don't.

## What can Employers Do?

Eve is very smart; in just a few years, she could be a very valuable software
engineer. But CAPITALISM TODO
 - they can't afford to pay her a salary and train her until she becomes useful
 - even if they did, eve would immediately leave for a higher paying job
 - better value to just hire Adam; he's actually worth his salary, even if he
   leaves after a few years.




## Is there any hope left?

So far, I've painted a very bleak picture. But there are a few solutions available
to the common american:
 - communities can fund their public schools. Unfortunately, this probably relies
   on raising taxes. Education is not high on the list of American values, so
   we will see how many communities take this route.
 - Khan Academy. While not a replacement for a proper education, I firmly believe
   that a self-motivated student armed with Khan Academy can do much better than
   the average American high school. With Khan Academy and other free online
   resources, perhaps young Americans can give themselves enough of a high school
   education to prepare for college.

But the challenge remains: how get into college? how to get employers to recognize?

To ensure the best possible future for Adam, his parents enroll him in a private
high school. This is expensive, but his parents have money.
