# Dystopian Pricing Strategies


 - different people willing to pay different amounts
    - average joe or jane
    - Mr. or Ms. Richy McRich Face
 - car salesman
 - watch an ad for a discount
 - time-of-day based dynamic pricing
 - income based dynamic pricing
    - can't just directly ask u for ur income...but google profile
 - spin the wheel / loot box
    - win a laptop!



Could this be good for society?
 - yes; in theory, poor people could buy food for less
 - no: more confusing prices tends to not be a good thing for the consumer
